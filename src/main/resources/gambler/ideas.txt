52 cards.

Playing a playing card puts it into a "hand".
A card is generated based on your "hand", which you can play like any other card.

The cards in your hand are consumed by this?
Or should the generated card be a one time thing and the playing cards are simply discarded?

Playing cards have effects of their own so that they're not just "do nothing"?

The generated card doesn't *require* 5 cards?
